# Chihuahua by Team WhyNot (Team No.: )

Students and professionals alike suffer from stress every day due to various factors such as poor work-life balance, unreasonable customers, relationship problems, and many more during the past few years. In some cases, they may even develop signs of anxiety and depression. As these stresses pile up, many feel the need for an outlet to express the various complaints and grievances that they accrue. Although several social media platforms are available for users to voice out their complaints, to date, none are specific to complaint content creation and has yet to take an active approach targeted towards these users, such as providing them with constructive feedback and addressing their mental well-being. 

A quick look at our main interfaces for Chihuahua:
